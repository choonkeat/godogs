Feature: eat godogs
  In order to be happy
  As a hungry gopher
  I need to be able to eat godogs

  Scenario: Eat 5 out of 12          # features/godogs.feature:6
    Given there are 12 godogs        # godogs_test.go:6 -> thereAreGodogs
      TODO: write pending definition
    When I eat 5                     # godogs_test.go:10 -> iEat
    Then there should be 7 remaining # godogs_test.go:14 -> thereShouldBeRemaining
